# Main Features
- Instant damage/refund calculation for three waves at once
- Set up a generic farming team, then swap out just the damage dealer/CE
- Save servant stats, farming teams, CEs, and enemy nodes for later
- Preloaded with lottery nodes/CEs up through JP
- Import/export saved data

# Project Goals
The goal (besides being a fun way for me to learn React/TypeScript) is to create a versatile farming calculator with a streamlined user interface.
Users should be able to find a comp that works 100% of the time with as little hassle as possible.

Presets are geared toward event farming, specifically lottery events where players will spend most of their apples running the same node over and over with a full team of useless drop CEs.
The application therefore makes the most pessimistic assumption possible in most cases: farming templates assume 0% starting gauge, calculations assume damage is min-rolled, and buffs that can miss are assumed to miss.

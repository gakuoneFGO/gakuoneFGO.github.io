v1
    manually entered buffs a la https://maketakunai.github.io/
    all servants available but only busters + a few standout quick/arts get template by default
    comparison table
    diagram fed by comparison table
    save custom servant configs (My Roster), templates, CEs
    node builder
    node database
v2
    refund (there are ways to chart refund that don't require any input besides the setup)
    proper modeling of buffs per servant, debuffs, charge management, etc
    skill database/skill-based input
    export to fga
    enemy database
    CE database
v3
    "ai"-driven node solving (add your roster, click a button and see all teams that clear it. can constrain by MC, etc)
        this can legitimately be trained using ai though? you have no problem generating enough data to train on
        the issue is figuring out how people normally train computers to play games nowadays, which I'm sure I can figure out
